## Description

In this project you will find 3 files. First there is the CleaningData.ipynb file, secondly the Data-analysis.ipynb and thirdly there is the Cleaning.py file with all the functtions.


### Description | CleaningData.ipynb

In this file you will find the cleaning of the shark attacks data set. This includes removing columns and rows as well as changing values to consequently optimize the data set and make the statistical analysis more efficient.

### Description | Data-analysis.ipynb

In this file you will find the results of cleaning the data to prove my hypothesis. 

HYPOTHESIS: I spent a year living in Sydney, Australia and have therefore heard a lot about sharks. The analysis of this dataset allows me to check if the 'myths' are really true.

1. Provoked attacks are proportionately more lethal than unprovoked ones
2. Most lethal attacks happen in New South Wales, Australia
3. The most lethal shark is the white shark
4. The most lethal activity for men is Swimming/Diving
